This project analyzes a real-world scenario where a SaaS company, **TechnoServe**, experienced a drop in sales pipeline conversion rates from **35% to 25%**.  
The objective was to identify the underlying drivers using structured problem-solving and data analysis, and propose high-impact recommendations.

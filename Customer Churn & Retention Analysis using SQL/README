# Customer Churn & Retention Analysis using SQL

## Business Context
Customer churn has a direct impact on revenue, profitability, and long-term growth in the banking industry.

While churn is often associated with low engagement, the data shows that even financially healthy and active customers may exit unexpectedly.  
The goal of this project was to identify hidden risk patterns early and recommend proactive retention strategies.

---

## Objective
To analyze behavioral and financial characteristics of customers using SQL and determine:
- Which customers are most likely to churn
- Why valuable customers leave
- Where preventive intervention can reduce future losses

---

## Dataset
Structured banking customer dataset containing:
- Churn status  
- Account balance  
- Tenure  
- Number of products  
- Activity indicators  

---

## Tools & Techniques
- SQL querying  
- Aggregations  
- Segmentation logic  
- Ranking of high-value customers  
- Behavioral pattern analysis  

---

## Analytical Approach

Customers were segmented into four major groups:

- Active & Retained  
- Active & Exited  
- Inactive & Retained  
- Inactive & Exited  

This helped distinguish between expected churn and unexpected churn.

---

## Key Insights

- A group of financially strong and actively engaged customers still exited the bank.
- Many inactive customers continue to stay due to high account balances acting as a financial anchor.
- Engagement alone is not a reliable predictor of loyalty.
- Customers with fewer products show weaker attachment and higher exit probability.
- Mid-tenure customers represent an important risk window.

---

## Recommendations

1. Track relationship health, not just activity metrics.
2. Use preventive incentives for inactive but high-value customers.
3. Increase product penetration early to build long-term stickiness.
4. Develop early warning signals combining tenure, balance, and engagement behavior.

## Expected Impact
A predictive, value-based retention strategy can help reduce high-impact customer losses and enable earlier intervention.
